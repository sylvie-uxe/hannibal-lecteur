# I have in ze bilouque

Welcome to my blog codebase! I built this blog with [Astro](https://astro.build/), using [Tina](https://tina.io/) as my Content Management System.
I'm using the great Astro blog theme [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/) that I've slightly customized.

## My personal blog

## Run it locally and be amazed. It's yours now!

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
